This is an unofficial small business website that I developed. The website is designed for a small business and aims to showcase its products, services, and contact information.

Technologies Used

The website is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It also uses various external libraries such as Font Awesome, and Normalize.

Features

The website features a responsive design that adapts to different screen sizes, making it easy to access and use on any device. It includes the following sections:

Home: This section includes a brief introduction of the business and its offerings.
Menu: This section displays the different menu items offered by the business, along with their prices.
About Us: This section provides more information about the business, its history, and its values.
Contact Us: This section includes contact information for the business, including a phone number, email address, and location on Google Maps.
